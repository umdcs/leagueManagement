	Get server talking to devices, view schedules, and input scores.
2.
	The team has talked about logistics in sending information between the view and model and server.
	Jeff is working on how to store information on the server
	Mark is working on the model and how to organize and store information in the local device. Also, worked on classes for league, team, and matches.
	Adam worked on the xml and creating another view and activity.
	Hunter is working on the activities and passing information from user input into the model and eventually stored in the server.

	If we were working together all of the time when coding, instead of doing the bulk of it alone, I believe we could have a much more cohesive project on our hands. I think we're working it out fine during our scrum meetings on what needs to be done, but we could have more communication.
4. Alas, we have not completed a user story by this point.

Our meeting went ok, I feel like we are a little behind in where we want to be, an accelerated work schedule from myself (Hunter) could improve this situation. I plan on implementing more UI components soon. We need to work on testing some of our more complicated methods.
