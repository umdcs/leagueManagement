Our unit test tests out League, Match and Team classes for functionality. League checks for the ability to add and remove teams from a league. It also tests how the schedule is created and if the scoreboard is being updated correctly. The Team class tests for schedule updates and adding and removing of players in a team. In addition the adding of scores for each team's matches. The match class tests for tests for determining the winner of a match.
